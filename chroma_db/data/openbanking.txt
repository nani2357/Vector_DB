Open Banking is a financial practice that involves the use of open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to enable third-party developers to build applications and services around financial institutions. It allows customers to share their financial data securely with third-party providers, such as fintech startups or other banks, to access innovative financial products and services. Open Banking promotes competition, innovation, and transparency in the banking industry by facilitating the exchange of financial information and encouraging collaboration among stakeholders. It enables consumers to manage their finances more effectively, compare products and services, and access personalized financial advice and solutions tailored to their needs and preferences. Open Banking has the potential to transform the way people bank and drive the development of new business models and partnerships in the financial sector.
