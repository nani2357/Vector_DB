It encompasses a wide range of technologies and applications, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and more. AI systems can analyze vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, make decisions, and even learn from experience. They are used in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment, to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and solve complex problems. As AI continues to advance, it holds the promise of revolutionizing how we work, live, and interact with technology.', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ai.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Unlike traditional programming, where explicit instructions are provided, machine learning algorithms learn from labeled or unlabeled data to find patterns and make informed decisions. There are various types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, each suited for different tasks and objectives. Machine learning has applications in areas such as image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, and autonomous vehicles, among others.', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\ml.txt'}),\n",
